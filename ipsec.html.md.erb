# Limitations & Risks

* You can only deploy RabbitMQ to a single AZ.
* You can only update the IP addresses of the HAProxy nodes, not the RabbitMQ Server nodes.
* All communication will *not* be encrypted by IPsec. As a result, we recommend you [configure
RabbitMQ for PCF to use TLS](install-config-pp.html#ssl).
* Each node with a static IP will now require 2 IP addresses, you should ensure you have the
appropriate number of IP addresses available.
* You cannot assign static IPs to nodes which have already been deployed using dynamic IPs.

# Installing the tile

1. Import and configure the RabbitMQ tile as usual, ensuring that you select only a single AZ.
1. On the Networking page enter the correct number of static IPs required for the number of HAProxy
and RabbitMQ Server nodes you have configured on the resources page. These must be in a subnet on
the AZ that you've configured the product to use.
1. Do not click Apply Changes until completing the following step.
1. Following the [IPsec Addon documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/installing.html#create-mfest)
add the static IPs you have configured to the `no_ipsec_subnets` list and update your runtime-config as the
guide recommends.
1. Go back to the Installation Dashboard and click Apply Changes to deploy the changes. This will cause an update
of all products, as the runtime-config has to be applied to all products.
1. Optionally, you can verify that traffic to the RabbitMQ Server and HAProxy nodes is unencrypted:
	1. SSH into a node which should not be encrypted
	1. Run `sudo tcpdump -i eth0 "ip proto 50"`, you should see no packets logged. This verifies there are no IPsec encrypted packets
	on that network interface. An IPsec encrypted packet will look like this:
	```
	11:13:07.801761 IP cloud-controller-0.node.dc1.cf.internal > ip-10-0-48-12.eu-west-1.compute.internal: ESP(spi=0xcbb4206d,seq=0x2e4), length 232
	```
