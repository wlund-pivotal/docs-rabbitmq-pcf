# Configuration

On the RabbitMQ for [Pivotal Cloud Foundry&reg;](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF) tile in Ops Manager, you can configure the following items:

## Management dashboard

You must choose an admin username and password for RabbitMQ.

This will grant you full admin access to RabbitMQ via the Management UI.

<%= image_tag("images/config_credentials.jpeg") %>

## Plugins

You can choose which plugins you wish to enable.

You must leave the management plugin enabled otherwise nothing will work.

<%= image_tag("images/config_plugins.jpeg") %>

[Click here for more information about RabbitMQ plugins](https://www.rabbitmq.com/plugins.html)

## HAProxy ports

You can choose which ports HAProxy should load balance to the RabbitMQ nodes.

<%= image_tag("images/config_haproxy.jpeg") %>

By default all the default ports of all the available plugins will be load-balanced.

However, if you install extra protocol plugins, or provide a custom configuration which changes the ports that RabbitMQ listens on then you must update the list of load-balanced ports.

Note that you must always leave the management plugin listening on port 15672 and load balance that port.

If you change the topology of your RabbitMQ cluster, the HAProxy is automatically reconfigured during the deployment.

### Port to protocol mappings

15672 = Management dashboard

5672 = RabbitMQ

5671 = RabbitMQ SSL

1883 = MQTT

8883 = MQTT SSL

61613 = STOMP

61614 = STOMP SSL

15674 = Web STOMP

4567 = RabbitMQ Service Broker

## Security Groups

To enable access to the RabbitMQ tile service, you will need to ensure your security
group allows access to the HAProxy and RabbitMQ Service Broker VMs configured in your deployment. The IP addresses
for these can be obtained from Ops Manager "Status" page for the RabbitMQ tile.
You should ensure the following ports are enabled for those VMs:
15672, 5672, 5671, 1883, 8883, 61613, 61614, 15674, 4567.

Here is a template for configuring your Cloud Foundry security groups:
```
[
{"protocol":"tcp","destination":"<haproxy-node-IP-addresses>","ports":"5671,5672,1883,8883,61613,61614,15672,15674"},
{"protocol":"tcp","destination":"<service-broker-node-IP-addresses>","ports":"4567"}
]
```

## SSL

You can provide SSL certificates and keys for use by the RabbitMQ cluster.

<%= image_tag("images/config_ssl.jpeg") %>

Note SSL is simultaneously provided on the AMQPS port (5671) and the management port (15672).

If you provide SSL keys and certificates, you are disabling non-SSL support.

No other plugins are automatically configured for use with SSL.

Note SSL settings are applied equally across all machines in the cluster.

## Erlang Cookie

You can provide an Erlang cookie to be used by the cluster if you wish.
This can be useful if you want to connect directly to the RabbitMQ cluster such as with `rabbitmqctl` or to connect other machines running Erlang.

<%= image_tag("images/config_erlang.jpeg") %>

## RabbitMQ Config

You can provide a full <code>rabbitmq.config</code> file, if you wish.

<%= image_tag("images/config_rabbitmq.jpeg") %>

This file is then provided to all the nodes in the cluster.

## TLS Support

TLS v1.0 is disabled by default, due to insecurities.

<%= image_tag("images/config_tls1.jpeg") %>

You can enable it again by ticking the checkbox.

TLS v1.1 and 1.2 are enabled by default and cannot be turned on or off.

## External load balancer
<%= image_tag("images/config_elb.jpeg") %>

You can configure a DNS name or IP address of an external load balancer to be returned in the binding credentials (`VCAP_SERVICES`) to application developers.
