# Operation Tips

## What should I check before deploying a new version of the tile?
Ensure that all nodes in the cluster are healthy via the RabbitMQ Management UI, or health metrics exposed via the firehose.  You cannot rely solely
on the `bosh instances` output as that reflects the state of the Erlang VM used by RabbitMQ and not
the RabbitMQ application.


## What is the correct way to stop and start RabbitMQ in PCF?
Only BOSH commands should be used by the operator to interact with the RabbitMQ application. For example:

`bosh stop rabbitmq-server`

`bosh start rabbitmq-server`

There are BOSH job lifecycle hooks which are only fired when rabbitmq-server is
stopped through BOSH.  You can also stop individual instances by running:

`bosh stop JOB [index]`

*Note* Do not use `monit stop rabbitmq-server` as this does not call the drain scripts.

## What happens when I run bosh stop rabbitmq-server?
BOSH starts the shutdown sequence from the bootstrap instance.

We start by telling the RabbitMQ application to shutdown and then shutdown the
Erlang VM within which it is running. If this succeeds, we run the following
checks to ensure that the RabbitMQ application and Erlang VM have stopped:

1. If `/var/vcap/sys/run/rabbitmq-server/pid` exists, check that the PID inside
this file does not point to a running Erlang VM process. Notice that we are
tracking the Erlang PID and not the RabbitMQ PID.
1. Check that `rabbitmqctl` does not return an Erlang VM PID

Once this completes on the bootstrap instance, BOSH will continue the same
sequence on the next instance. All remaining rabbitmq-server instances will be
stopped one by one.

## What happens when bosh stop rabbitmq-server fails?
If the `bosh stop` fails, you will likely get an error saying that the drain
script failed with:

```
result: 1 of 1 drain scripts failed. Failed Jobs: rabbitmq-server.
```

## What do I do when bosh stop rabbitmq-server fails?
The drain script logs to `/var/vcap/sys/log/rabbtimq-server/drain.log`. If you
have a remote syslog configured, this will appear as the `rmq_server_drain`
program.

First, `bosh ssh` into the failing rabbitmq-server instance and start the
rabbimtq-server job by running `monit start rabbitmq-server`). You will not be
able to start the job via `bosh start` as this always runs the drain script first
and will fail since the drain script is failing. Once rabbitmq-server job is
running (confirm this via `monit status`), run `DEBUG=1`
`/var/vcap/jobs/rabbitmq-server/bin/drain`. This will tell you exactly why it’s
failing.
