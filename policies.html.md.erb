# RabbitMQ Policy

The configuration box shown below can be used by Operators to set a defult queue and/or exchange policy to be applied to their RabbitMQ cluster.  It is advised that after deployment all configuration is done via the RabbitMQ Management Interface.

An example policy is provided in the confguration box, but it is not enabled or applied and is intended only as a guide.  Operators should consider some of the performance implications of making queuss and exchanges highly available, and refer to the following documenation for more information: https://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html

The following rules apply to polices set via this confguration box:

* The policy is only applied to new instances
* Any existing instances will not have the policy applied
* The policy can be updated in OpsManager and this will only be applied to any new instances created there after
* The policy can only be deleted manually from the RabbitMQ nodes
* Polcies can be added dynamically using the RabbitMQ Managemnt Interface

## Viewing or changing the policy
In OpsManager on the RabbitMQ tile, there is a left hand menu item called `RabbitMQ Policy`  The checkbox is not enabled by default and so no policy will be applied.

The policy must be valid JSON and it should use valid RabbitMQ policy criteria.
This is not validated during the deployment, so any errors could either cause the deployment to fail or policies to not be applied correctly.

For more information, view [RabbitMQ Policies](http://www.rabbitmq.com/parameters.html#policies).

## RabbitMQ dashboard

You can view the policy on the RabbitMQ Dashboard. The URL can be obtained from your `VCAP_SERVICES` for application developers.

The example policy is applied to all queues, with a rank of 50 so it can be overriden by defining your own policy with a higher rank.

You can see any new queues created have the policy automatically applied.

## Network partition behavior

It is possible to change how you would want RabbitMQ to act once it discovers there has been a network partition.  The two options are `pause_minority` and `autoheal`, and more detail on these settings can be found here: https://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html

You must set the choose the option you want before deploying, or the default `pause_minority` will be used.  For production purposes we recomend that customers have at least 3 RabbitMQ server nodes and 2 HAproxy spread across low latency availability zones.
