# RabbitMQ Policy

The configuration box shown below can be used by Operators to set a default queue and an exchange policy to be applied to their RabbitMQ cluster. We recommend that you use the RabbitMQ Management Interface to make configuration changes after deployment.

An example policy is provided in the configuration box, but it is not enabled or applied and is intended only as a guide. Operators should consider some of the performance implications of making queuss and exchanges highly available, and refer to the following documentation for more information: https://www.rabbitmq.com/ha.html

The following rules apply to polices set through this configuration box:

* The policy is only applied to new instances
* Any existing instances will not have the policy applied
* The policy can be updated in Ops Manager, and will be applied only to any new instances
* The policy can only be deleted manually from the RabbitMQ nodes
* Policies can be added dynamically using the RabbitMQ Management Interface

## Viewing or changing the policy
In Ops Manager on the RabbitMQ tile is a left-hand menu item named **RabbitMQ Policy**. The checkbox is not enabled by default, and so no policy will be applied.

The policy must be valid JSON and should meet valid RabbitMQ policy criteria.
No validation occurs during the deployment, and errors can cause the deployment to fail or policies to be applied incorrectly.

For more information, view [RabbitMQ Policies](http://www.rabbitmq.com/parameters.html#policies).

## RabbitMQ dashboard

You can view the policy on the RabbitMQ Dashboard. You can obtain the URL can be obtained from the your `VCAP_SERVICES` for application developers.

The example policy is applied to all queues and given a rank of `50`. This allows you to override it by defining your own policy with a higher rank.

You can see any new queues created have the policy automatically applied.

## Network partition behavior

You can change how RabbitMQ acts once it discovers there has been a network partition. The two options are `pause_minority` and `autoheal`, and more detail on these settings can be found here: https://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html

You must choose the option you want before deploying, or the default `pause_minority` will be used. For production purposes, we recommend that customers have at least three RabbitMQ server nodes and two HAProxies spread across low latency availability zones.
