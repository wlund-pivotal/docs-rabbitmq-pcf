title: Monitoring and KPIs for On-Demand RabbitMQ for PCF
owner: London Services

[//]: # (Keep changes to this page in sync with monitor-pp.html.md.erb - especially the #rabbit-mq metrics table)

This topic explains how to monitor the health of the on-demand version of the RabbitMQ for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) service using the logs, metrics, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) generated by RabbitMQ for PCF component VMs.

On-demand RabbitMQ for PCF components generate many of the [same metrics](./monitor-pp.html) as the pre-provisioned RabbitMQ service components.

[//]: # (, but with the prefix `p.rabbitmq` instead of `p-rabbitmq`.)

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: As of v1.8.2, on-demand RabbitMQ for PCF emits metrics prefixed with <code>p-rabbitmq</code>. In future releases they will be be prefixed with <code>p.rabbitmq</code> (with a dot), to distinguish them from pre-provisioned service metrics. This is a <a href="./releases.html#18x">known issue</a>.</p>

See [Logging and Metrics](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/loggregator/index.html) for general information about logging and metrics in PCF.

## <a id="config"></a>Direct the Logs

As of RabbitMQ for PCF v1.9.0, syslog forwarding is preconfigured and set to on by default.
Pivotal recommends that you keep the default setting because it is good operational practice.
However, you can opt out by selecting **No** for **Do you want to configure syslog?** in the Ops Manager **Settings** tab.

To enable monitoring for RabbitMQ for PCF, operators designate an external syslog endpoint for RabbitMQ component log messages. 
The endpoint serves as the input to a monitoring platform such as Datadog, Papertrail, or SumoLogic. </br>

To specify the destination for RabbitMQ for PCF log messages, do the following:

1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the RabbitMQ tile.
1. In the RabbitMQ tile, click the **Settings** tab.
  ![Ops Manager Syslog Forwarding Configuration](images/syslog-config-1.9.0.png)
1. Click **Syslog**.
1. Enter your syslog address and port.
  ![Configure syslog pane](syslog-config.png)
1. Click **Save**.
1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes** to redeploy with the changes.

###<a id="log-format"></a> Logging Format

With on-demand RabbitMQ for PCF logging configured, two types of components generate logs: the server nodes and the service broker:

* The logs for RabbitMQ server nodes follow the format <code>[job=rabbitmq-server-partition-GUID index=0]</code>
* The logs for the RabbitMQ service broker follow the format <code>[job=rabbitmq-broker-partition-GUID index=0]</code>

The RabbitMQ VMs log at the <code>info</code> level and capture errors, warnings, and informational messages.

## <a id="metrics"></a>Metrics

Metrics are regularly-generated log messages that report measured component states. The metrics polling interval defaults to 30 seconds.
This interval is a configuration option on the RabbitMQ tile (**Settings** > **RabbitMQ**).  The interval setting applies to all components deployed by the tile.

Metrics are long, single lines of text that follow the format:

```mac
origin:"p-rabbitmq" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:1441188462382091652 deployment:"cf-rabbitmq" job:"cf-rabbitmq-node" index:"0" ip:"10.244.3.46" valueMetric: < name:"/p-rabbitmq/rabbitmq/system/memory" value:1024 unit:"MB">
```

### <a id="partition-indicator"></a>Partition Indicator

A new metric has been introduced to help to identify network partitions.
Essentially it exposes how many nodes each node knows. When a node is in
partition the only node that it recognizes is itself and that is a good
indication that that node might be in a partition.

An example of that metrics is:

```mac
origin:"p-rabbitmq" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:1441188462382091652 deployment:"cf-rabbitmq" job:"cf-rabbitmq-node" index:"0" ip:"10.244.3.46" valueMetric: < name:"/p-rabbitmq/rabbitmq/erlang/reachable_nodes" value:3 unit:"count">
```

Monitors can be created to emit alerts in case a cluster seems to be in a
partition. A metrics is emitted for each node in the cluster. For example: in a
three-node cluster a monitor can expect to have a total of 9 (nine) since each
node is expected to emit 3 (2 reachable nodes and itself). Otherwise, an alert
can be sent to the team.


## Recovering from a network partition
Please refer to the oficial RabbitMQ guide to understand how to recover from a network partition:
https://www.rabbitmq.com/partitions.html


## <a id="kpi"></a>Key Performance Indicators

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for RabbitMQ for PCF are metrics that operators find most useful for monitoring their RabbitMQ service to ensure smooth operation. KPIs are high-signal-value metrics that can indicate emerging issues. KPIs can be raw component metrics or _derived_ metrics generated by applying formulas to raw metrics.

Pivotal provides the following KPIs as general alerting and response guidance for typical RabbitMQ for PCF installations. 
Pivotal recommends that operators continue to fine-tune the alert measures to their installation by observing historical trends. 
Pivotal also recommends that operators expand beyond this guidance and create new, installation-specific monitoring
metrics, thresholds, and alerts based on learning from their own installations.

For a list of all RabbitMQ for PCF raw component metrics, see [Component Metrics Reference](#reference).

### <a id="heartbeats"></a>Component Heartbeats

Key RabbitMQ for PCF components periodically emit heartbeat metrics: the RabbitMQ server nodes, HAProxy nodes, and the Service Broker. The heartbeats are Boolean metrics, where <code>1</code> means the system is available, and <code>0</code> or the absence of a heartbeat metric means the service is not responding and should be investigated.

#### <a id="broker-heartbeat"></a> Service Broker Heartbeat

<table>
   <tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align: center;"><br> p-rabbitmq.service_broker.heartbeat<br><br></th></tr>
   <tr>
      <th width="25%">Description</th>
      <td>RabbitMQ Service Broker <code>is alive</code> poll, which indicates if the component is available and able to respond to requests.<br><br>
   
      <strong>Use</strong>: If the Service Broker does not emit heartbeats, this indicates that it is offline. The Service Broker is required to create, update, and delete service instances, which are critical for dependent tiles such as Spring Cloud Services and Spring Cloud Data Flow.

### <a id="server-kpis"></a>RabbitMQ Server KPIs

The following KPIs from the RabbitMQ server component:

   <tr>
      <th width="25%">Description</th>
      <td>File descriptors consumed.<br><br>
   
      <strong>Use</strong>: If the number of file descriptors consumed becomes too large, the VM may lose the ability to perform disk IO, which can cause data loss. 
      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This assumes non-persistent messages are handled by retries or some other logic by the producers.</p>

### <a id="bosh"></a> BOSH System Metrics

All BOSH-deployed components generate the following system metrics. Coming from RabbitMQ for PCF components, these system metrics serve as KPIs for the RabbitMQ for PCF service.

#### <a id="ram"></a> RAM

<table>
   <tr><th colspan="2" style="text-align: center;"><br> system.mem.percent <br><br></th></tr>
   <tr>
      <th width="25%">Description</th>
      <td>RAM being consumed by the <code>p-rabbitmq</code> VM.<br><br>
   
      <strong>Use</strong>: RabbitMQ is considered to be in a good state when it has little or no messages. 
              In other words, "an empty rabbit is a happy rabbit." 
              Alerting on this metric can indicate that there are too few consumers or apps that read messages from the queue.
