## What are dedicated instances and when to use them with RabbitMQ (link to ODB Documentation)
Right now (for PCF RabbitMQ versions before 1.8.0), the RabbitMQ Service
instances correspond to a unique RabbitMQ Vhost on the multi-tenant RabbitMQ
cluster. In PCF RabbitMQ 1.8.0, we are introducing [On-Demand Broker
(ODB)](/on-demand-service-broker/index.html) support (experimental). That means
that a new cluster can be created and decicated to a single application
(single-tenant).
