## What are dedicated instances and when to use them with RabbitMQ (link to ODB Documentation)
Right now (for PCF RabbitMQ versions before 1.8.0), the RabbitMQ Service
instances correspond to a unique RabbitMQ Vhost on the multi-tenant RabbitMQ
cluster. In PCF RabbitMQ 1.8.0, we are introducing [On-Demand Broker
(ODB)](/on-demand-service-broker/index.html) support (experimental). That means
that a new cluster can be created and decicated to a single application
(single-tenant).

## Entries in the VCAP_SERVICES Environment Variable
Applications running in Cloud Foundry gain access to the bound service instances via an environment variable credentials hash called `VCAP_SERVICES`. An example hash is show below:

<pre><code>
{
    "p-rabbitmq": [{
        "credentials": {
            "dashboard_url": "http://pivotal-rabbitmq.your.pcf.example.com/#/login/b5d0ad14-4352-48e8-8982-d5b1d257029f/tavk86pnnns1ddiqpsdtbchurn",
            "username": "b5d0ad14-4352-48e8-8982-d5b1d257029f",
            "password": "tavk86pnnns1ddiqpsdtbchurn",
            "protocols": {
                "amqp": {
                    "password": "tavk86pnnns1ddiqpsdtbchurn",
                    "username": "b5d0ad14-4352-48e8-8982-d5b1d257029f",
                    "uris": [
                        "amqp://b5d0ad14-4352-48e8-8982-d5b1d257029f:tavk86pnnns1ddiqpsdtbchurn@10.0.0.41:5672/62e5ab21-7b38-44ac-b139-6aa97af01cd7",
                        "amqp://b5d0ad14-4352-48e8-8982-d5b1d257029f:tavk86pnnns1ddiqpsdtbchurn@10.0.0.51:5672/62e5ab21-7b38-44ac-b139-6aa97af01cd7"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    }]
}
</code></pre>

The `credentials` property can be used as follows:

* The top level properties `username`, `password` provide access to the AMQP 0.9.1 protocol.

* A more flexible approach is provided by the `credentials.protocols` property, which has a key per enabled protocol. The possible key is `amqp`.

* The values associated with each of these keys gives access credentials specific to each protocol. In all cases, URIs are provided, along with the individual components.
